# Prediction-of-Covid-19-Positive-Risk-of-Survey-Responders-in-the-United-States

The COVID-19 pandemic has decreased the world population drastically and posted unprecedented threats to societal structure
such as the health and food systems. Although many countries have come up with numerous preventative measures and guides 
of good practices in beliefs that, if the measures and practices are properly followed, their citizensâ€™ risks of catching the disease
will be lowered. However, the controversies around the effectiveness of such measures and guides never cease to exist. 
Therefore, being able to determine factors that lead to higher risks of catching Covid-19 could reduce controversies while 
saving lives. In this paper, three predictive models for Covid-19 predictions are used, namely logistic regression, decision trees, 
and random forest. Out of the three models, the decision tree gives poor results as indicated by around 50%, whereas random 
forest and logistic regression perform well, with bootstrap forest giving the highest R-square value. Logistic regression performs 
better on new data and gives more correct predictions as indicated by 60%, and therefore is the best out of three. The variables 
of importance identified from the models are.
